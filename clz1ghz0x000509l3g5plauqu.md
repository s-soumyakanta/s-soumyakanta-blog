In this comprehensive guide, we unravel the mystery of resetting your Git branch to a specific commit. Whether you’re battling with recent bugs or need to discard problematic changes, our step-by-step tutorial will help you swiftly navigate back to a stable state, ensuring your project stays on track. Click through to learn how you can effortlessly master this essential Git skill and solve your development woes.

### Introduction

If you’ve ever found yourself tangled in a web of commits and need to reset your project to a specific point in time, Git provides a powerful tool to help you do just that. This guide will walk you through the steps to reset your branch to a specific commit hash, ensuring you can get your project back on track with ease.

### Why Reset to a Specific Commit?

Sometimes, during development, you may encounter issues due to recent changes. Resetting to a specific commit allows you to revert your project to a stable state. This can be particularly useful if:

* You’ve introduced bugs that are difficult to trace.
    
* Your recent changes have led to instability.
    
* You need to discard changes that are no longer needed.
    

### Step-by-Step Guide to Resetting to a Specific Commit

#### 1\. Check Your Current Git Log

First, you need to identify the commit you want to reset to. Use the following command to view your commit history:

```plaintext
git log --oneline
```

This will display a list of commits, each with a unique commit hash. Here’s an example:

```plaintext
4755fca (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge pull request #3 from s-soumyakanta/auth
02cf3af dark mode not working yet, code without User Profile
5aade78 complete mongo db auth with new ui
5c0f767 new ui with auth till mongo db  
c7812d5 Basic local auth done
56747be minor css fix
3ab55a0 minor css fix
```

#### 2\. Note the Target Commit Hash

Identify the commit hash you want to reset to. For example, if you want to reset to the commit `4755fca`, make a note of this hash.

#### 3\. Checkout the Master Branch

Ensure you are on the branch you want to reset. Typically, this would be the master branch. Use the following command:

```plaintext
git checkout master
```

#### 4\. Reset the Branch to the Specific Commit

Now, use the `git reset` command to reset your branch to the specific commit. The `--hard` option will discard all changes in the working directory and staging area, aligning them with the specified commit.

```plaintext
git reset --hard 4755fca
```

**Note:** The `--hard` option will remove all uncommitted changes. If you want to keep your changes, you can use `--soft` or `--mixed` instead.

#### 5\. Push the Changes to the Remote Repository

If you need to update the remote repository to reflect this reset, you must force push the changes. Use the following command:

```plaintext
git push origin master --force
```

**Warning:** Force pushing will overwrite the history on the remote branch. Ensure that this is what you want to do, especially if you are working in a shared repository.

### Conclusion

Resetting your branch to a specific commit can be a lifesaver when dealing with problematic changes. By following these steps, you can effectively revert your project to a stable state, allowing you to continue development without the recent issues.

Remember to use these commands with caution, particularly `--hard` reset and `--force` push, as they can lead to data loss if not used correctly. Happy coding!
